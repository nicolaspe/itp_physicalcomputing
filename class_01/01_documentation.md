### Let's get Physical

Crawford, The Art of Interactive Design, chapters 1 and 2


After this class’ discussion and exercise, and reading Chris Crawford’s definition and Bret Victor’s rant, how would you define physical interaction? What makes for good physical interaction? Are there works from others that you would say are good examples of digital technology that are not interactive? Write an introductory blog post and send the link to your instructor for inclusion in your class page.
