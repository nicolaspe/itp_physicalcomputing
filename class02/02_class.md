# Intro to Physical Computing - Sept 13

### Reflections on the readings
Screens are general purpose interfaces. It doesn't make much sense for them to do many things. It limits the interaction capabilities/possibilities. It is economical, one thing for all; but it fails to provide an adequate answer for many tools.

A lot of interaction comes from games. There, you are not trying to make something simple, you want to make it challenging, rewarding, to feel correct. They have been very disrupting in the world of user interface.

Some services have diluted the barriers between both worlds. Lyft is a "digital" app, but the effects are extremely physical. Getting into a car, traveling home, interacting with the driver and even smelling the car.

Technology now advances extremely fast, in a yearly basis. That may allow newer generations to adapt faster. Before you could see where things were going, you had time to understand it and slowly get in the wagon. Now things are thrown to your face. You either get it or not. You HAVE to adapt.

Movie: [California Typewriter](http://californiatypewritermovie.com/). About why people use the typewriter, the beauty of the sound, the need to have a physical object. It is interesting to explore.


### She's electric
Electricity is a form of energy. Breaks down into AC (~ Alternate Current) and DC (Direct Current). DC divides into power and electronics, which parts itself into analog and digital.

The world is analog. But when we transform into electricity, we translate everything into a digital world, only 0 or 1.

### Let's get Physical (and build things)
Every circuit needs a power supply. Electricity travels from the positive to the negative (of the supply). Though, in general, we don't have a *minus*, but a '0' or GND (ground). This is essential, because it is a value that every circuit shares.

If we connect two lamps, they become very dim! We could think as if they don't have enough power.

Colors means polarity. Red = positive, Black = ground.

When we connect things one after another, the circuit is in **series**. This distributes the voltage of the power supply! And if one of the lights burn, then the circuit would not be completed and nothing would work!

Some components (diodes) have a strict polarity, they won't work if the cables are reversed. But others (fans, etc) will change the direction in which they work when the polarity is reversed!

Switches can me momentary or constant, normally open or normally closed.


### Assignment
- Quiz
- Create a creative SWITCH (have fun with it!) (NOT buzzer? > Conductive thread and fabrics on the SOFT LAB!!)
